### **Definitions**

**p-value:** Observed p-value

**Statistical Power (1-β):** Acceptable false negative error rates. Clinical trials often have a statistical power of 80% or 90%, which corresponds to a β of 0.2 or 0.1.
              
**Prior probability:** Prior probability of true positive (i.e. the replicability of positive study findings). In other words, what proportion of similar positive studies have historically been successfully replicated. For major clinical trials, a study by Ioannidis showed reported that of 29 major RCTs that were challenged in replication studies, 20 were successfully replicated, 6 RCTs showed smaller effects compared to what was intitially observed, and 3 were contradicted (Tables 1 and 2, in [1]). That leads to a replication probablity of 69% for major RCTs. In psychology, replication studies have reported successfull replication in 36%-50% of cases [2, 3].

**Calculation Method** PPV = (1 − β)R⁄(R − βR + α) where α is false positive error rate, β is false-negative error rate, and R is the 
ratio of true relationships to no relationships.

This formula can be derived from a 2x2 table, as shown in [4]."
