### **How to use this app:**

**Prior probability:** Prior probability of true positive or the proportion of similar positive studies that have historically been successfully replicated. Prior probability is context-specific. For major clinical trials, a study by Ioannidis showed that of the 29 major RCTs that were challenged in replication studies, 20 were successfully replicated, 6 RCTs showed smaller effects compared to what was intitially observed, and 3 were contradicted [1]. As such, a replication probablity of 69% is calculated for major RCTs. In psychology, reproducibility projects have reported successful replication of 36%-50% of studies [2, 3]. Replication rate is believed to be lower in basic and preclinical research, with estimates varying from 10% to 25% [4]. 

**Statistical power (1-Î²):** The probability that the study will detect an effect when an effect is present. Power depends on the significance level, sample size, and the magnitude of the effect. Clinical trials often have a statistical power of 80% or 90%.

**p-value:** Observed p-value
        
**Calculation method:** Please refer to the 2x2 table in [5].
